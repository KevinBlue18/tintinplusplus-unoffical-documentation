This is an unofficial documentation resource for the TinTin++ client (hopefully a community effort). The documentation for TinTin++ is not automatically built and is severely out of date. Because user's (including myself) are constantly asking the same questions on the `tintin forums <http://tintin.sourceforge.net/board/>`_, I have attempted to document those features that cause the most issues here and lay the documentation out such that the starting sections begin with the questions and issues encountered by the newest users and the later sections are those encountered by more advanced users.

The cookbook exists outside of this layout and consists of 'shorter' recipes to perform very specific tasks that are commonly inquired about on the forums.
