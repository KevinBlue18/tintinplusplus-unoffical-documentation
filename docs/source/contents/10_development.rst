I'm trying to hack at the sphinx documentation a bit to add related content, integrated discussions via disqus, livereload support, and issue submission links for each page, so that an issue can be submit directly to the github issue tracker for documentation corrections.

I've got some notes below on adding these features.


---------------
Related Content
---------------
Add support for page tags and automatic interlinking. This way recipes in the cookbook page could be tagged by "feature" and automatically included in the feature pages.

- `Finding Related Content with Sphinx  <http://rhnh.net/2008/05/31/finding-related-content-with-sphinx>`_
- `Blogging with Sphinx                 <http://eseth.org/2010/blogging-with-sphinx.html>`_


------
Disqus
------
Add disqus support for integrated discussions on specific documentation pages.


-----------
Live Reload
-----------
Add livereload support for automatic rebuilding of local wiki while editing.

- `Adding LiveReload Support to Sphinx  <http://serialized.net/2013/01/live-sphinx-documentation-preview/>`_


-------------
Github Issues
-------------
Add links that allow users to directly submit github issues for documentation corrections.
